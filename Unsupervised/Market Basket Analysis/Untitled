clustering and pattern detection

training on unlabeled data

detecting anamalous behaviours, such as unauthorized 

used for knowledge discovery

#Agglomerative (Bottom - up) Clustering
-> merging clusters into progressively large clusters
-> Dendrogram is the shape formed

#Divisive (Top - Bottom) Clustering


#Market Basket Analysis
Impulse purchases 

@Association rules (if-then)
building block  - each item that could appear
itemsets   - frequently bought together sets
-> helpful for finding the patterns

@Statistical 
support = ocurrence/total
confidence(X->Y) = suppOrt(X,Y)/support(X)
